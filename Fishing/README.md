Description: This script is for three tick fishing.

Instructions:
  Start runescape and leave the window on its default size settings. Drag the OSRS client to the top right of your screen.
  
  Log into your account now.
  
  Place swamp tar and a herb in the 3rd and 4th inventory slots (Order does not matter). Do not forget to bring a pestle and mortar in       order to go through the animation of grinding a herb.
  
  Make sure to leave your 5th inventory slot empty because the script will drop fish from that slot.
  
  Align the fishing slot directly in front of your character, zoom in fully, and press the up arrow until the camera is no longer rotating.
  
  Now open the script and run (compiler must have windows.h library to run).

Notes:
  There are many instructions so far that require a lot of human input in order to ensure that the script can run. It is my intention to update this script so that it can recognize certain items.
